# LeNet_AlexNet_VGG_GoogleNet_ResNet_DenseNet-From-Scratch

In this repository I will implement some popular Convolutional Neural Networks from scratch (without using pretrained model) such as LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, GoogleNet, ResNet, DenseNet, etc. Here I’m assuming that you are familiar with Deep Learning concepts. Moreover, you also know a bit about how optimization techniques such as SGD, Adam. But even if you’re not familiar with any of the above, you can look at the code, image and running it, after that you can research later.

But why implementing a Convolutional Neural Networks from scratch at all? Even if you can use pretrained model. I don't know how it is important for everyone, but for me implementing a network from scratch at least once is an extremely valuable exercise. It helps me gain an understanding of how neural networks work, and that is essential for designing effective models later.

I hope this repository can also help everyone who are studying about these networks have problems with their code when trying to implement this so they can go here and try my notebook for getting more understanding.
